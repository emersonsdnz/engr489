\section*{March 1st}

The first meeting of the uni trimester. We went over my work with the C2000 microcontroller over summer, and what I'd done with it. We went over the project plan, and what I needed to accomplish. I had been able to drive a motor with three-phase AC, and Adam wanted me to get AC waves of different magnitudes and phases at the same time. Also, different waveforms - for instance, one full AC wave and one half-wave (just the top half). The synchronization and timing of AC waveforms were going to be very important, so I was to test how reliable this was. We also agreed that 11am Friday was going to be our regular meeting time. The rest of the day, I spent working on testing the GaN inverter board.
